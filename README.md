# Banking-Application
Java provides a robust set of libraries and frameworks that make it easy to develop a banking application.

In this article, we will take a look at how to build a simple banking application using Java. Our application will have the following basic functionality:

*Check balance
*Deposit money
*Withdraw money
*Exit the application

The main class of our application will be called “Bank”. In this class, we will define the main method and the basic functionality of our application. The main method will be responsible for displaying the menu to the user and handling the user’s input.

So here the menu will consist of four options:

*Check balance
*Deposit money
*Withdraw money
*Exit the application
The user will be prompted to select an option by entering a number between 1 and 4. If the user enters an invalid option, the application will display an error message and prompt the user to enter a valid option.
